# NEGF


Description of the project
	this code takes hemiltonian matrix and trasfer matrix and generates density	
	of state(DOS) and transmission of the system. 


install/ run the project:
	main.py -p y -t y (name of the input folder)
	-p for plotting data if -p is not 'y' then it will save the figure but will
	not display
	-t to generate the file 'time.dat', that keeps track of time it took to perform several 
	important calculations.	


how to use the project/ prerequisite to run the project:
	The folder 'input' and 'output' and the file 'main.py' must be in the same 
	directory. 
	'input' folder can contain several folders. However, each folder must 
	contain file 'h00', 'hp1' and 'hn1'. h00 defines the hamiltonian matrix. 
	hp1 and hn1	is the right and left transfer matrix respectively.
